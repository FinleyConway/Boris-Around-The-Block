 My first game I created with a team for a Game Jam.

The theme for the Game Jam was "Stuck In A Loop" and our team thought we should make a game revolved around walking a dog each day in the same street and findng something different happen each day. Each day the player found that some areas were blocked off due to last night experiences such a storm ect and the player would need to reroute to a different location. This cause the player to talk to different people each day to which lead the player going to the dog park at the end of the week with all the people the player has talked to.

Alot of what I described above isnt fully accurate due to short amount of time the Game Jam gave us and a series of events which some of the team memebers had to do which leading them to not help as much as they wanted to.

Overall, this isnt a bad attempt and was quite good learning experience of making a game from scratch under a certain time which lead you to learn something new because of the pressure of the short time we had.
